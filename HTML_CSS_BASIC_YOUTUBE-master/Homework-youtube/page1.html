                    <p>Near the Tottori sand dunes stands The Sand Museum, a unique museum that displays large sand sculptures by artists from around the world. In the past, sand exhibitions were held outdoors and in temporary structures, but in 2012 the sand museum moved into its own permanent building.</p>
