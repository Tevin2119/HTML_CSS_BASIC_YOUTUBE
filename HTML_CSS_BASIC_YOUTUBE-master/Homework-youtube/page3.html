                    <p>Arashiyama Station is a special place in Japan where creatures welcome curious visitors: Iwatayama Monkey Park. Here you can find wild Japanese macaque monkeysâ€”which are often seen on popular travel guides and brochures taking a restful dip in onsen during winter. At Iwatayama you can see them fully active, running and swinging around the park.</p>
